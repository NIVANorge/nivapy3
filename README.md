# nivapy3

## NIVA-specific Python functions for NIVA's JupyterHub

This library was originally part of the `NIVANorge/niva_datasci_toolkit` repository. It contains various Python functions to streamline workflows on NIVA's JupyterHub.

**Note:** `nivapy3` library has a lot OS-level dependencies, as well as some customisations that are specific to NIVA's JupyterHub. **It therefore cannot be easily installed in other Python environments**.
